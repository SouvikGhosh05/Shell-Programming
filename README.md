# Shell-Programming

This repository is about shell scripting. Bash shell is the core command line interpreter of the Linux operating system.
Bash is a general purpose, portable and extensible Unix shell. It is the default shell on most Unix-like operating systems.
But for MacOS, Zsh is the default shell.
